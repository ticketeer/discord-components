### Usage inside Markdown files

If you're using a static site generator like [VuePress 2](https://v2.vuepress.vuejs.org/) and want to use these components inside your Markdown files, you should use them with PascalCase names:

```html
<DiscordMessages>
  <DiscordMessage>...</DiscordMessage>
</DiscordMessages>
```

This is the recommended approach due to how VuePress renders Markdown and HTML inside Markdown files. It doesn't recognize `<discord-messages>` as an HTML element, therefore rendering anything indented inside it as a regular codeblock.

### Upgrading from vue-discord-message

The components have been kept mostly the same, with many improvements and some breaking changes. `@discord-components/vue` doesn't support Vue 2 (yet), so be sure you're using Vue 3 with this package. [vue-discord-message](https://github.com/ticketeer/vue-discord-message) supports Vue 2 but is outdated.

**New**:

- Components: `DiscordButton(s)`, `DiscordInteraction`, `DiscordMarkdown`, and `DiscordReaction(s)`
- Slots inside the `DiscordMessage` component: `actions` for buttons, `interactions` for replies and slash commands, `reactions` for reactions

**Breaking**:

- Components are no longer globally registered. It's recommended to import them where necessary, or you may globally register them yourself
- The `componentNames` and `disableFont` plugin options have been removed
- The `EmbedField(s)` components have been renamed to `DiscordEmbedField(s)`
- The `Mention` component has been renamed to `DiscordMention`
- These component props have been renamed:
  - `DiscordEmbed#authorImage` -> `DiscordEmbed#authorIcon`
  - `DiscordEmbed#color` -> `DiscordEmbed#borderColor`
  - `DiscordEmbed#footerImage` -> `DiscordEmbed#footerIcon`
  - `DiscordEmbed#title` -> `DiscordEmbed#embedTitle`
  - `EmbedField#title` -> `DiscordEmbedField#fieldTitle`
  - `Mention#color` -> `DiscordMention#roleColor`
